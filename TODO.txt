                Techniques: 
                        Classic CV (pattern matching, manually-programmed feature analysis etc. May or may not leverage optimization algorithms, like genetic, PSO, etc.)
                        Classic ML (SVM, Random Forest, K-NN, LVQ, etc.)

OK              Instead, just add a "only wrong classifications" filter then sort by offtopic?
                Potential max. 177 false offtopics of 11709?


OK      Fix server-side search not being capable of searching strings that are JSON keys (as they return all rows because they have the key)?
