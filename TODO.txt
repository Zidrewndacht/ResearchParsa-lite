OK                      Force-disable most eyecandy entirely if density is larger than most desktops (as it's likely a ~4K laptop suffering on battery);
OK                              Backdrop-filtering alone was mauling the poor UHD 620 on the 4K C630 Yoga ex-Chromebook...

        Refactor browse_db.py (too large)?
OK              Getting rid of server-side stats and search already reduced it a bit, still unwieldy;
                Moving SQLite logic to a separate file for DB operations may cause 
                        'sqlite3.ProgrammingError: SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread. The object was created in thread id 34640 and this is thread id 16976.'
                Moving helpers away is fine, but there are only three.

        Refactor comms.js
                Works fine, just need some better mantainability. Low priority.

        Isolate most domain-specific logic where possible -- long term, complicated refactor with little usefulness for now:
                separate fixed from domain-specific HTML templates;
                add a python file exclusive for the domain-specific details (DB schema, JSON schemas, etc) and change existing scripts to use it accordingly;
                separate JS for logic that access the domain-specific HTML parts from generic JS
                See docs.md for info on some domain-specific scattered code.
                
                Implement ResearchParça Lite, a standalone non-domain-specific PDF organizer/annotator instead, so at least the annotator can be used for other researchers.

        Add multiuser capability (naming users, user-selectable DB) -- good for offline "sneakernet" collaboration;
                Possibly auth for online server hosting? -- low priority

        Low relevance XHR limitations/fixes:
                Update commented&other field displays on save.
                Update PDF icon on first annotation without manual reload.

        Automatic add/remove paywalled icon to papers based on user trace containing 'paywalled' string;
